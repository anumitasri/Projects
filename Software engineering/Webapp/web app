Create a Web application that converts a given amount of money in one currency to an equal value in a different currency. You must use the currency conversion rates from the MySQL database called currency, which is available on uml.cs.uga.edu.  The database contains the conversion rates on a selection of 35 world currencies. The user name and password are given in the file /home/profs/kochut/csx050/CurrencyConverter.txt, also available on uml.

It is your responsibility to discover the table and column names and create a suitable SQL query to retrieve the necessary data.  For example, you may use the mysql command to connect to the currency database and then discover the table name(s), as well the defined columns and their types. All of the currency exchange rates in the database are expressed in terms of 1 US Dollar.

Your application must utilize a Java servlet and an HTML form. The WAR archive of your application must have a name of the form firstname_lastname_currency.war. Furthermore, your application must be available at the following URL (of course, substitute your own name for firstname and lastname):
http://uml.cs.uga.edu:8080/firstname_lastname_currency/converter.html
The converter.html page should provide a suitable interface (an HTML form) allowing the user to select the source and target currencies, and entering the amount of money for the conversion.  The currencies must be given by their international symbols (you may use drop-down lists).  Make sure to round the result to just 2 digits after the decimal point.  The conversion from one currency to another should be done with an intermediate conversion to the US Dollar, if necessary. Your application must return suitable error messages, when needed.
